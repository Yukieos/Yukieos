### About Me

I love building things at the intersection of **AI**, **visual computing**, and **real-world usability**. Whether it's fine-tuning language models, visualizing electric fields in 3D, or deploying grocery recognition systems, I'm most excited when tech becomes *useful* and *usable*.

Built with **Ruby + TypeScript**.

→ [Web app](https://funradar-b8f29a7d90f1.herokuapp.com/)

#### Grocery Price Comparison App
A full-stack image-based grocery search tool.  
Fine-tuned a **MobileNetV3** model and integrated **EasyOCR** to extract product data from grocery images.  
Built with **FastAPI + PostgreSQL + React.js + SwiftUI**.  
→ [Web app](https://groceryapp-website.onrender.com/) | [iOS Demo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ThKRE7pBXVwkVrnv8XigoxLiNiJuPj6Q/view?usp=sharing)

#### Roleplay ChatBot (Hugging Face Demo)
Custom chatbot powered by **Google Gemma model + LoRA fine-tuning**, supporting MBTI-based personas and memory.  
Deployed via **Gradio Spaces**, featuring artistic UI, user ratings, and feedback-based personalization.  
→ [Live Demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/yukieos/RoleplayDemo)

#### 3D Electric Field Visualization
Interactive 3D simulations built with **Three.js + Svelte**, modeling test charge motion in customizable E-fields.  
Great for physics education and real-time force visualization.
